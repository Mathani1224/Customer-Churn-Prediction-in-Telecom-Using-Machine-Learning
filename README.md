The Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Using Machine Learning project analyzes customer data to identify patterns leading to churn. By using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest, the model predicts which customers are likely to leave a telecom service. This helps companies take proactive steps to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.
